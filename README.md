# ZenTasks

### Java Version (2.1.1)


I have decided to take the time to learn the Play! Framework inside and out as I now have some time. I will store my source code here from the `ZenTasks` tutorial provided in the [Documentation](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.1/JavaGuide1) section for Java on the Play! site.
